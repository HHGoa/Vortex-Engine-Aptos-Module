### Vortex Engine Move Contract

Unlock the power of on-chain game development with the Vortex Engine Move contract for Aptos! This contract seamlessly integrates with the Vortex Engine suite, enabling developers to manage and store game data efficiently on the blockchain. It features the `EntityList` struct for organizing entries with IPFS hashes, timestamps, and wallet addresses. Key functionalities include creating new entry lists (`create_list`), adding game-related entries (`create_entry`), and robust error handling. With built-in tests to ensure reliability and accuracy, this contract provides a solid foundation for building immersive and secure on-chain gaming experiences.

For the "Best Build on Aptos" track, we deployed a custom module to store essential game data, including timestamps, user wallet addresses, and entry IDs. This data is fetched into our scanner, providing users with a comprehensive view of their game transaction history. We chose the Aptos chain for its exceptional transaction speed, ensuring a seamless gaming experience. Due to challenges with existing Aptos documentation, we also created our own detailed integration guide.
